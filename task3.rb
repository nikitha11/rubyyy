# 3. Your boss walks up to your desk in a foul mood. "Just look at this list of email addresses." 
# "Some of the email addresses have capital letters in them! I need you to fix this." 
# She hands you an array of email addresses and she'd like back an array of all-lowercase email addresses. 
# She gives you an hour because she thinks you're going to have to go through this by hand. 
# Instead, you have a bright idea: you'll write some Ruby to solve this problem.
# # List of email address: 
# KuLDeeP@GmaiL.coM 
# SaCHiN@QwiNiX.iO 
# SuNiL@gMaiL.com 
# SuJiNA@QWINIX.IO
